# Project Structure

## Abstract
Define what your project is about and what will be the uses of it
## Define the Problem Statement

## Data Acquisition 
Mention the various data sources. For example I have added Kaggle, you can add more while you describe the project.

 1. Kaggle

## Data Preprocessing
1. Processing data for ingestion into tensorflow
Various data preprocessing steps.  (Check out these and similar notebooks https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection/code?datasetId=686454&searchQuery=data)
## Data Visualization
Data Visualization Steps (Check out these and similar notebooks https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection/code?datasetId=686454&searchQuery=data)
## Model Building
1. Building baseline Convolutional Neural Networks
## Running experiments (Weights and Bias or Tensorboard)
Machine Learning and Deep Learning models require multiple experiments while developing them to get the right hyper parameters in order to get the best accuracy.
## Finetuning the Model
We will try to compete against the baseline model to outperform that.
## Hyper-Parameter Tuning - AutoML
## Evaluating the model
Validation and Evaluation for the accuracy and checking if the losses lower
## Prediction 
Implement prediction so that the model ingests the image and extracts the number plate.

------
# Transfer Learning & Model Comparison and Results
## Comparison with respect to the available models in market
## Transfer learning with VG16 model
## Comparison with the baseline model

-----
# MLOps
## Deploying and Saving the best Model
We will be using streamlit for the above.
## Demo App for The model
We will build the demo app using streamlit
## Deployment of the app (streamlit)
Same as above.
